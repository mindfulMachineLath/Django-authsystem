Templates
=========

``allauth`` ships many templates, viewable in the
`allauth/templates <https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/tree/main/allauth/templates>`__
directory.

For instance, the view corresponding to the ``account_login`` URL uses the
template ``account/login.html``. If you create a file with this name in your
code layout, it can override the one shipped with ``allauth``.
