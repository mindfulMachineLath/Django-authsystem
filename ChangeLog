	* The e-mail authentication backend now attempts to use the
	'username' parameter as an e-mail address. This is needed to
	properly integrate with other apps invoking authenticate.

2011-05-29  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* SmileyChris contributed support for automatically generating a
	user name at signup when ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED is set to
	False.

	* Vuong Nguyen contributed support for (optionally) asking for the
	password just once during signup
	(ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_VERIFICATION).

2011-04-22  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* The Twitter oauth sequence now respects the "oauth_callback"
	parameter instead of defaulting to the callback URL
	configured at Twitter.

2011-04-14  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Pass along "?next=" parameter between login and signup views.

	* Added Dutch translation.

2011-04-12  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Added template tags for pointing to social login URLs. These
	tags automatically pass along any "?next="
	parameter. Additionally, added an overall allauth_tags that
	gracefully degrades when e.g. allauth.facebook is not installed.

2011-04-11  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Pass along next URL, if any, at /accounts/social/signup/.

	* Duplicate email address handling could throw a
	MultipleObjectsReturned exception, fixed.

2011-04-10  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Removed separate social account login view, in favour of having
	a single unified login view including both forms of login.

2011-04-07  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Added support for passing along a next URL parameter to
	Facebook, OpenID logins.

2011-02-13  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* Added support for django-avatar, copying the Twitter profile
	image locally on signup.

2010-11-12  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* allauth/account/forms.py (BaseSignupForm.clean_email): With
	ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED=False, empty email addresses were
	considered duplicates. Fixed.

2010-11-12  Raymond Penners  <raymond.penners@intenct.nl>

	* The existing migrations for allauth.openid were not compatible
	with MySQL due to the use of an URLField with max_length above
	255. The issue has now been addressed but unfortunately at the
	cost of the existing migrations for this app. Existing
	installations will have to be dealt with manually (altering the
	"identity" column of OpenIDAccount, deleting ghost migrations).
